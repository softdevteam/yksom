initSidebarItems({"mod":[["compiler","A SOM compiler. This is currently fairly simplistic, particularly in terms of code generation (though it does at least use lrpar, so one gets decent error messages). The interchange format between the compiler and the VM currently uses a Rust `enum` and is probably fairly inefficient."],["vm","The yksom run-time. The run-time uses trait objects but stores them as thin pointers (using the experimental natrob library. This allows integer tagging to be used. The `Val` struct stores tagged integers / pointers to boxed objects. The `Obj` trait is the “supertype” trait of all objects, but it is not intended that most parts of the VM call `Obj` directly: one should use the identically named methods on `Val`. As this suggests, users should, in most cases, either operate directly on a `Val` or `Val::downcast` (or `Val::try_downcast`) it to a concrete implementation of `Obj`."]]});
